PHASE I

THE THEMIS PROJECT
Reconciling Human and Digital Ontologies

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Establishing the purpose — the telos — of Artificial 
General Intelligence in human-digital interfaces.

This website documents the Themis Project as a living 
workspace. What you see is active development. 

The work speaks for itself.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PROBLEM

Current AI architectures have a ceiling — not in 
capability, but in kind.

Scaling improves performance. It does not produce 
understanding. No amount of data, parameters, or 
training will cross this barrier.

The barrier is structural. 

This project has identified what is missing.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE WORK

Phase I delivers:

• Semantic Validity Architecture — six constraints 
  that any valid claim must satisfy

• Three-Axis Framework — the irreducible structure 
  of knower, known, and means

• Closure Authority — which decisions belong to 
  humans, which to machines

• Nine Application Domains — from defense to 
  self-knowledge

• Seven Patent Families — filed, documented, available 
  for evaluation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT COMES NEXT

Phase I is foundation.

What comes next is larger — a framework for genuine 
knowing in the age of AI, and an institution to 
carry it forward.

The curious will see the trajectory.

**Design notes:**
- Keep the dark navy aesthetic
- "PHASE I" should be smaller, above the main title
- "THE THEMIS PROJECT" is the hero text, large
- "Reconciling Human and Digital Ontologies" is the subtitle
- [ENTER THE PROJECT] is a CTA button that goes to the Architecture page
- **NO personal names anywhere on landing page**

ABOUT THE THEMIS PROJECT

The Themis Project is a research and development initiative 
dedicated to establishing the structural foundations of 
artificial general intelligence.

Phase I — "Reconciling Human and Digital Ontologies" — 
addresses the semantic validity problem: why current AI 
systems cannot distinguish knowledge from belief, and 
what architecture is required to cross that barrier.

The work draws on foundations tested for twenty-four 
centuries and applies them to the human-AI systems 
emerging today.

Seven patent families have been filed. The architecture 
is documented publicly. Evaluation is invited.

---

THE NAME

Themis (Θέμις) is the Greek goddess of divine law, 
order, and justice. She represents right order — 
the proper relation between things.

The Themis Project seeks to establish right order 
between human and artificial intelligence: what 
each can do, what each should do, and where 
authority properly resides.
